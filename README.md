This repository features a detailed case study on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing for insurance claims data. The project provides insights into customer demographics, claim patterns, fraudulent activities, and other key factors impacting the insurance industry. The dataset and Python scripts allow for an in-depth analysis and visualization of trends and patterns in insurance claims.
